# bookStore_webservice
A light book-store web service implemented In Go.

This repository presents a simple design pattern of a basic web service for Book Store using Go programming language. The adopted pattern is simplified and easy enough to build new feature on top.

Please note that, I used ElephantSQL which can be found here ---> "https://customer.elephantsql.com/"  for PostgreSQL Database.

Enjoy :)
